# Traffic Management System

The project is to help the local police department with their installation of security cameras at traffic intersections. You will solve a particular kind of optimization problem, called the Vertex Cover problem, in thiscontext.
The idea is for the police to be able to minimize the number of cameras they need toinstall, and still be as effective as possible with their monitoring.

Key technologies: Python, C++, MiniSAT, Multiprocessing, Multithread

# A1
Input street data, output the graph of this street.

# A2
Input graph and two points, output the shortest path from one point to another.

# A3
Generate random street data to A1. A1 outputs result graph to A2. Input two points and output the shortest path. (Based on Inter-Process Communication (IPC))

# A4
Input graph, solve the minimal Vertex Cover problem using MiniSAT and output the minimal Vertex Cover.

# Project
Input graph, solve the minimal Vertex Cover problem using MiniSAT and two other greedy algorithms (based on multithread), output the mini Vertex Cover.
